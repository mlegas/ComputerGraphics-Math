# ComputerGraphics-Math
A framework that draws and showcases a number of essential shapes for computer graphics using SDL and GLM.

The user, using a text menu, can draw:
-	Basic 2D shapes
-	Filled 2D shapes
-	A showcase of matrix transformations on a 2D square
-	A rotating 2D square (animated)
-	Bezier curves
-	Fractal sets: Cantor, Sierpinski and Mandelbrot
-	A rotating 3D pyramid (animated)

## How to operate the program

1. Click on the terminal.
2. Type in the number with the wanted option.
3. Press Enter to confirm.
4. Wait for the drawing process to be finished (this usually only applies to fractal sets).
5. Click on the MCG window.
6. Press TAB while focused on it to return back to a menu.
7. Repeat.

To quit the program, return to the main menu by inputting a zero.
Or close the terminal window for an uncontrolled exit.

## Note

Please beware that clicking on the terminal window when it has not finished writing text might
cause the text to disappear and force the user to restart the program (or use the program blindly). 

Make sure the text for the menus has reappeared when you return from a drawing on the MCG window before clicking.

To be 100% insured that nothing bugs out, focus on the windows by clicking the title bar of the windows.

Besides that, enjoy!
